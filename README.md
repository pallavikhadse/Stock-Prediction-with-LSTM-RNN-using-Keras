# Stock-Prediction-with-LSTM-RNN-using-Keras

Following two models with 1 year and 3 years dataset respectively were built and their results were analyzed"

1. LSTM Model with 1 year of Stock data of Google, Amazon and Apple. Timestep of 30 days. Multivariate features - Open prices of Google, Amazon and Apple. Data splitted into 70%-30% Training and Testing respectively. Validation data of 10% of Training data considered.

2. LSTM Model with 3 years of Stock data of Google, Amazon and Apple. Timestep of 60 days. Multivariate features - Open prices of Google, Amazon and Apple. Data splitted into 60%-40% Training and Testing respectively. Validation data of 10% of Training data considered.
